= Template and InstanceType Management

== Introduction

Pre-configured Red Hat virtual machine templates are listed in the *Virtualization* -> *Templates* page. These templates are available for different versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, Microsoft Windows Desktop, and Microsoft Windows Server editions. Each Red Hat virtual machine template is preconfigured with an operating system image, the default settings for the operating system, the flavor (CPU and memory), and the workload type (server).

The *Templates* page displays four types of virtual machine templates:

* *Red Hat Supported* templates are fully supported by Red Hat.
* *User Supported* templates are *Red Hat Supported* templates that were cloned and created by users.
* *Red Hat Provided* templates have limited support from Red Hat.
* *User Provided* templates are *Red Hat Provided* templates that were cloned and created by users.

== Prepare for the lab

. The tasks that we are about to perform will require us to provision a few additional VMs. In preparation we are going to ask that you shut down the existing *fedora01* and *fedora02* virtual machines to ensure that your shared environment has enough resources to complete the lab.

. Navigate to *Virtualization -> Virtualmachines*
. If any VMs are showing a status of *Running* click the three dots to the right and select *Stop*.

Now all VMs should be in *Stopped* state.

[[clone_customize_template]]
== Clone and Customize a Template

By default pre-configured the templates provided by Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization cannot be customized. However you can clone a template and make adjustments to it for your particular workload in order to make it easier to request specific types of virtual machines for specific workloads. In this section of the lab we are going to do just this, by creating a template that will provide a preconfigured database server on demand for our end users.

. To begin, navigate to *Virtualization* -> *Templates* and select *openshift* for your project (you may need to open the *Project* drop-down and click the radio button next to *Show default projects*).
+

. In the search bar type in *centos9* and in the list of templates that appear find the template for *centos-stream9-server-small*.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/02_Search_Centos9.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click on the template name for *centos-stream9-server-small*, you will be prompted with a message that default templates cannot be edited and asked if you'd like to clone. Click the *Create a new custom Template* option.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/03_Create_Custom_Template.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. A new menu called *Clone template* will appear, fill in the the following values, and when finished click on the *Clone* button.
+
* *Template name:* centos-stream9-server-db-small
* *Template project:* vmexamples-{user}
* *Template display name:* CentOS Stream 9 VM - Database Template Small
+
image::module-07-tempinst/04_Clone_Template_Options.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. This will take you to the *Details* page for the template where we will be able to customize some options. Start by finding the CPU and Memory near the bottom of the page, and click on the pencil icon to edit it.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/05_Clone_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. A new window will pop out where you can edit the amount of CPU and Memory. For our custom template set the value of CPUs to 2, and Memory to 4 GiB, and click the *Save* button.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/06_Edit_CPU_Mem.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Next click on the *Scripts* tab at the top, and in the section called *Cloud-init* click the *Edit* button.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/09_Scripts_CloudInit.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. When the *Cloud-init* dialog opens, click the radio button to *Configure via: Script* then *replace* the YAML with the following YAML snippet.
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
userData: |-
  #cloud-config
  user: centos
  password: ${CLOUD_USER_PASSWORD}
  chpasswd: { expire: False }
  packages:
  - mariadb-server
  runcmd:
  - systemctl enable mariadb
  - systemctl start mariadb
----
+

. Click the *Save* button, followed by the *Apply* button.

. Now click on the *Virtualization -> Catalog* menu on the left, select the *Template catalog* option and *User Template*. You should see your created template available as a tile with all the others.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/11_User_Templates.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click on the tile and you will be prompted with the VM startup screen. Click the *Quick create VirtualMachine* button.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/12_Quick_Create_Template.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. When the virtual machine boots you can see on the *Overview* page that it was created from our template, and has the additional resources we defined. We just need to verify that it installed *MariaDB* for us.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/13_VM_From_Template.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click on the *Console* tab at the top and use the *Guest login credentials* option to login to the console of the virtual machine.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/14_VM_Console.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Once you are logged into the virtual machine, run the following command to test the install of MariaDB.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sudo mysql -u root

. Hit `Ctrl-D` twice to log out of the VM.

[[instance_types]]
== Introduction to Instance Types

In order to simplify the deployment process for virtual machines, starting with OpenShift 4.14 the default configuration mechanism was changed to emphasize the use of *Instance Types*. An instance type is a reusable object where you can define resources and characteristics to apply to a new VM. You can define custom instance types or use the variety that are included when you install OpenShift Virtualization when provisioning your own VM. This section explores provisioning a VM using an instance type.

. To get started click on *Virtualization* -> *Catalog* on the left-side menu. You will see the default catalog item is *InstanceType*.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/31_Left_Menu_Catalog.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. The first step to using an instance type is to select a volume to boot from. Similar to the templates that provide boot sources, those boot sources are available to use for guests provisioned with an InstanceType. You can see the included volumes by selecting the *openshift-virtualization-os-images* project, or you can upload your own with the *Add volume* button.
+
NOTE: The *Add Volume* option will be greyed out if you aren't in a project that you have read/write access to.

+
image::module-07-tempinst/32_Volume_Boot.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click on the *rhel9* boot volume to select it as the volume type to boot from. Selecting it will be denoted by a small vertical blue line to the left of the image name.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/33_Select_RHEL9.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Next you can select the instance type you would like to use. There are Red Hat provided instance types by default, or you can create your own. If you hover over a provided instance type you can see a description of it's intended use.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/34_Select_InstanceType.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
* The Red Hat provided instance types are intended for the following uses:
** n1: Designed for network intensive workloads like VNF
** cx1: Intended for compute intensive workloads
** u1: The most general and "universal" workloads
** gn1: Dedicated for VMs making use of the nVidia GPU operator.
** m1: Designed for memory intensive workloads.

. Click on the *U series* tile to see a dropdown list of defined resources for general instance types. The default option here is *medium: 1 CPUs, 4 GiB Memory*. Select it.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/35_InstanceType_Resources.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. The last section that needs to be completed to provision using an instance type is similar to the template section. You need to provide a name for the virtual machine, and select the storage class to be used for a backing disk. By default, a name will be generated for the VM, and the default storage class will be selected. When you are satisfied, click the *Create VirtualMachine* button.
+
image::module-07-tempinst/36_VM_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. You will be directed to the virtual machine overview page, and see that the VM provisioned using an instance type is now up and running.

[[cleanup]]
== Cleanup

To save resources for the next lab, stop the VMs that you created in this module.

. Navigate to *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines*
. If any VMs are showing a status of *Running* click the three dots to the right and select *Stop*.

Now all VMs should be in *Stopped* state.

== Summary

In this section we learned how to clone and customize and existing template to create one that can be used for specific workloads like databases. We also introduced how to make use of instance types to further customize our virtual machines for specific workloads.
